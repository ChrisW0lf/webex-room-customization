# Be Right Back
### Show meeting participants automatically when you're away from your Cisco Webex DeskPro.

Did you always need to step away from your DeskPro while in a call and forget to mute yourself? 
With **BeRightBack** People Presence will detect if you're away, change your background to an Image you have uploaded to the **User1** slot and mute yourself.
After coming back your background will change to your last setting and your microphone unmuted as well.
