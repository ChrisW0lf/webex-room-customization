#### Cisco Video Endpoint Macro Repository by Christian Wolf

## Welcome!
Hey there, thanks for finding my repository!

Here you can find a selection of my macros for CE Room Devices. Macros are a great feature intruduced in CE9.2 that allows you to customise your Room Device. They are especially powerful in combination with the In-Room Control Extensions of any Cisco Webex Touch Device.

#### Macros available:

| Macro        | Description           |
| :------------------------ |:-------------|
| [ImmersiveComposing](https://github.com/ChrisW0lf/webex-room-customization/tree/main/DeskPro_ImmersiveComposing) | Turn your Cisco Webex DeskPro into a home video studio |
| [ImmersiveVideo](https://github.com/ChrisW0lf/webex-room-customization/tree/main/DeskPro_ImmersiveVideo) | Enable flexibility in your immersive video experience on your Cisco Webex DeskPro |


## Requirements
1. Cisco Room Device (MX, SX, DX, Room, Board or Desk series).
2. Firmware CE9.2.1 or newer. Some macro using newer features require newer firmware.
3. Admin user access to endpoint.

## Getting Started
Read the document [Working with Macros and In-room Controls](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce92/sx-mx-dx-room-kit-customization-guide-ce92.pdf) for a comprehensive introduction of In-Room Controls, Macros as well as step-by-step instructions on how to build and upload your code.

## Additional Information
##### XAPI
Documentation for the XAPI can be found in the [Command References overview](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/telepresence-quick-set-series/products-command-reference-list.html).

## Disclaimer
Those examples are only samples and are **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample macros are meant to:
- Illustrate how to use the CE Macros.
- Serve as an example of the step by step process of building a macro using JavaScript and integration with the Codec XAPI.

The sample macros are made available to Cisco partners and customers as a convenience to help minimize the cost of Cisco Finesse customizations. Cisco does not permit the use of this library in customer deployments that do not include Cisco Video Endpoint Hardware.
